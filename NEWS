Changes from Ant-Eclipse 0.3 to Ant-Eclipse 1.0
===============================================

~ Duplicated dependencies on Java libraries are referred only once in
  a generated project. The last occurence "wins". It allows a direct usage
  of references to class paths without listing the libraries one by one
  only because some of them have a source code attached. Source code of a
  library is not a part of class path elements but it is necessary to
  generate a dependency for Eclipse with sources and javadoc.
+ Javadoc can be attached to a library dependency (source has been already
  available).
+ A new attribute "updatealways" of the alement "eclipse" forces regeneration
  of the projects files even if the build script has not been changed. It
  allows updating if the system environment has been changed which can cause
  different paths to be used in generated files.
+ The attribute "compilercompliance" in the element "jdtcore" allows "6.0"
  for the Mustang sources.

Changes from Ant-Eclipse 0.2 to Ant-Eclipse 0.3
===============================================

+ Support of AJDT has been added in addition to the JDT support.

Changes from Ant-Eclipse 0.1 to Ant-Eclipse 0.2
===============================================

Changes that could break older environments:
--------------------------------------------

~ Semantics of <settings> has changed to be more general. The attribute
  "version" has been moved into every child element representing a single
  file with properties. The attribute "encoding" has been moved into
  <resources> where it belongs logically.

Other changes:
--------------

~ More property files in the directory ".settings" are supported as elements
  under the element <settings> making <settings> only a container of
  preferences.
+ preferences are described either with the low-level <preferences> or
  convenient high-level descriptions:
   <resources> for org.eclipse.core.resources.pref
   <runtime> for org.eclipse.core.runtime.pref
   <jdkcore> for org.eclipse.jdk.core.pref
   <jdkui> for org.eclipse.jdk.ui.pref

Fixed bugs:
-----------

(none)

Features in Ant-Eclipse 0.1
===========================

+ task <eclipse> encapsulating all files Eclipse needs as a project
  configuration.
+ <settings> under <eclipse> configuring the file
  .settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.pref
  with attributes "version" and "encoding"
+ <project> under <eclipse> configuring the file .project
  with the single attribute "name"
+ <classpath> under <eclipse> configuring the file .classpath with elements
  <container>, <source>, <library>, <variable> and <output> corresponding
  with the kinds of elements <classpathentry> under <classpath>: "con", "src",
  "lib", "var", "output"
